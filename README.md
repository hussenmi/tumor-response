# Analysis of Patient-Derived Xenografts (PDXs) using Bayesian methods and HMM

In this repo:

- I developed a Bayesian method-based approach for drug discovery, focusing on analyzing tumor progression in patient-derived xenografts (PDXs). This strategy aims to personalize treatment by enhancing the prediction of treatment efficacy across various cancer types, leveraging PDX data for more accurate and targeted drug development
- Applied a Hidden Markov Model to classify tumor progression graphs into responsive or non-responsive categories based on volume changes over time, and for each classified category, constructed hierarchical probabilistic models in PyMC to predict and understand the progression patterns of tumors under various treatments
- Employed probabilistic matrix factorization to infer effective treatment combinations for specific patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) where treatment data is lacking. This approach, vital in drug discovery, offers a cost-effective solution for exploring numerous treatment combinations that are otherwise unfeasible to test comprehensively
